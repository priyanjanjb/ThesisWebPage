# A Neural Network Approach for Detecting Combined Dual Hand Gestures Based on Surface Electromyography Signals

This project is a web application used to demonstrate my research on detecting combined dual hand gestures using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and neural networks. The application provides an in-depth look at how machine learning techniques can be applied to recognize complex hand gestures through sEMG data, with potential applications in fields such as prosthetics, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction.
